## The Tidyverse

When the programing language R was developed the focus was on inferential statistics for small to medium sized data sets. The scientific approach usually constituted of the following steps: Formulate a hypothesis, chose an apropriate method to falsify the hypothesis, collect data, and calculate the results. Data collection was usually tedious and costly. 

Since then, the rise of information technology has caused a massive collection of data, also referred to as data deluge. Datasets have become bigger in both numbers (observations) and variables. With the abundance of data came a new approach to research: data-driven science or simply data science. The objective is to "understand and analyze actual phenomena with data". To put it in other words: to make sense of data that has already been collected. 

For many of those taks the available R function were tedeous and slow. This prompted the development of the Tidyverse, a collection of R packages specifically designed for data science. A good resource for everything related to the Tidyverse is [www.tidyverse.com](https://www.tidyverse.com).

The Tidyverse can be installed from the console by simple typing:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. This allows a smooth and frictionless transition between the different steps that are usually involved in a data science project.

This course will follow this structure because most applied projects do. We will not limit ourselves to Tidyverse packages, but it is important to be able to identify and understand both baseR as well as the tidyverse dialect.
